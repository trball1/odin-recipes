    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I created this minestrone soup after becoming tired of the excess salt and lack of veggies in canned ones. I based this recipe off of the delicious, vegetable-rich minestrone served at Sheepherder's Inn in Sacramento, California. Serve with hearty bread, romaine salad, and a nice merlot.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>5 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>½ cup red wine (optional)</li>
        <li>3 zucchinis, quartered and sliced</li>
        <li>2 cups baby spinach, rinsed</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh or frozen green beans, cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup canned kidney beans, drained</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup seashell pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese for topping</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large stockpot over medium-low heat. Sauté garlic in hot oil until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add celery and carrots; sauté for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in tomato sauce, broth, and water; bring to a boil, stirring frequently. Add red wine; reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Stir in zucchinis, spinach, green beans, kidney beans, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer until soup is heated through, 30 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, fill a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil. Cook seashell pasta in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place 2 tablespoons cooked pasta into individual serving bowls. Ladle soup over pasta and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with olive oil to serve.</li>
    </ol>
