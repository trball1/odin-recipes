    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pickled onions perk up anything they’re added to: all manner of green and grain salads, omelets, sandwiches, burgers, tacos, even a bowl of beans. This recipe makes pickled onions that have a good balance of salty, slightly sweet, and sharp taste and tenderness, without any raw bite left in them. One way to play around here is to throw in some spices or other aromatics — try crushed coriander, star anise, bay leaves, dried chilies, cloves, peppercorns, cloves of garlic, or slices of ginger.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large red onion</li>
        <li>1/3 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the onion, then slice it into rings 1/8 inch wide or thinner using a mandoline or a sharp chef ’s knife and a steady hand.</li>
        <li>Combine the white and rice vinegars, water, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then add the onions.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the onions until they soften and are submerged in the brine; this will take 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let cool completely.</li>
        <li>Transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator, where they’ll keep for several weeks.</li>
    </ol>
